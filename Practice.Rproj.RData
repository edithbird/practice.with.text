```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```



2_D scatter plot
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = mpg)+geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
str(mpg)
```

Change the color. Has to be done manually, outside of the geom function, i.e., outside of aes parenthesis. Same for the size of a geom_point.

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg)+geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy), color = "blue", size = 2)
```

Add another level of the data, class, to the plot, by associating the name of the aesthetic to the name of the variable. It adds a legend. Notice the warning generated, using size for a discrete variable is not advised. 
```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg)+geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class, size = class))
```

Can also use alpha which controls transparency. 

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg)+geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy), color = class, alpha = class)
```

Or shape, will only use 6 at a time, and unused groups will go unplotted. 
```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg)+geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class, shape = class))
```


```{r}
head(cars)
ggplot(data = cars)+geom_point(mapping = aes(x = speed, y = dist))

```

Plus + can not be at the beginning of a line. Code won't run
```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg)
+ geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class))
```

Splitting plots into facets. To do this with a single DISCRETE variable, use facet_wrap()
```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg)+ geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))+ facet_wrap(~cyl, nrow = 3)
```

To facet with 2 variables, use facet_grid with a ~ between the variables.
```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg)+ geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))+ facet_grid(drv ~ cyl)
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg)+ geom_point(mapping = aes(x = drv, y = cyl))#+ facet_grid(drv ~ cyl)
```
